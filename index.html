    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Gone are the days of waiting for months to receive a letter from your friend or relative residing in a distant place. At the click of some buttons you can talk to anyone sitting in a remote part of the world. Earlier people used to flock to library for research work or pleasure reading which has now been replaced with e books and search engines. Some 100 years back, people could not predict the incoming hurricane, its position and time of attack but now anyone with a mobile phone can find these details and interpret it accurately. The outdoor activities have now been replaced with computers and Play Station. Now a days, kids prefer spending time on what their virtual friends are up to rather than spending quality time with their family or friends.

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">These E-wastes are getting dumped onto fields polluting the land and a lot of natural resources are wasted.
